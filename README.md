## Overview

This repository now exposes a **single Cloudflare Worker** with a modular router
(`workers/router.js`). It dispatches incoming requests to pure handler functions:

- `handleWhatsAppRequest` â€“ `/whatsapp/incoming` webhook for Twilio
- `handleImagesRequest` â€“ serves `/images/*` from R2
- `handleAdminRequest` â€“ lightweight dashboard at `/admin`
- `handleSummaryRequest` â€“ read-only summaries under `/summary/*`
- `handleUploadHookRequest` â€“ GitHub webhook `/uploadhook`
- `handleDocSyncRequest` â€“ manual ingestion at `/internal/doc-sync`
- Shared utilities live under `shared/` for GPT, embeddings, chunking and more.

For detailed prompt configuration, see [VIBE_PROMPT.md](docs/issues/05-closed/VIBE_PROMPT.md).

## Development & Deployment

Develop and deploy the router with standard Wrangler commands:

```bash
# Local development
wrangler dev

# Deployment
wrangler deploy
```

## Pre-commit

Install Wrangler (if needed) and run pre-commit hooks:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Testing

Run unit tests with Node's built-in test runner:

```bash
npm test
```

## Usage

- Configure your Twilio WhatsApp webhook to point to `/whatsapp/incoming` (e.g., `https://<your-domain>/whatsapp/incoming`).
- Trigger document synchronization by POSTing to `/internal/doc-sync` or via a scheduled cron/CLI.
- Point your GitHub webhook to `/uploadhook` to automate updates.
