# Changelog

## [1.20.4] - 2025-01-07

- **User-Friendly Availability**: Removed overwhelming slot counts (no more "229 available times") - now just says "available appointment times"
- **Simplified Display**: Shows only 3-4 relevant time ranges instead of confusing total slot counts
- **Better UX**: Focuses on what matters (actual available times) rather than technical details

## [1.20.3] - 2025-01-07

- **Smart Time Validation**: Added intelligent handling of specific time requests ("Monday at 5pm") with service duration logic
- **Service Duration Awareness**: System now calculates if 2.5-hour services can fit in requested time slots

## [1.20.2] - 2025-07-07

- **🚨 CRITICAL FIX**: Recursive loop bug causing HTTP 522 errors in availability function
- **Direct Internal Calls**: Changed from external HTTP calls to direct worker calls to avoid loops
- **Availability FINALLY Working**: AI now properly shows 229+ available time slots instead of "no availability"
- **Root Cause**: Function was calling `https://wa.tataoro.com/booksy/timeslots` creating worker→self loop

- **Result**: "🎉 AVAILABILITY CONFIRMED: I found 229 available appointment times across 13 days"
