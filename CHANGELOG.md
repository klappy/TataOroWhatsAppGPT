# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.9.1] - 2025-01-27

### üîÑ **RETRY LOGIC & USER COMMUNICATION: Never Leave Users Hanging!**

**MOTIVATION**: Users deserve to know what's happening when scraping takes time, and we should give things a second shot before falling back to backup data.

#### üó£Ô∏è **TRANSPARENT USER COMMUNICATION**

- **Retry notifications**: "I'm having trouble getting the latest info. Let me try again! ‚è≥"
- **Success celebrations**: "Great! I was able to get the current details on my second attempt!"
- **Honest failure communication**: "I tried twice but had some technical issues. Here's what I can tell you!"
- **Always valuable**: Even with technical difficulties, users always get helpful information

#### üîÑ **SMART RETRY LOGIC**

- **Two-attempt strategy**: Every function gets at least one retry before giving up
- **Progressive timeouts**: First attempt (12s), retry attempt (15s) for better success
- **Failure tracking**: Only counts as circuit breaker failure after both attempts fail
- **Retry metadata**: Track successful retries for user communication

#### üí¨ **ENHANCED USER EXPERIENCE**

**Before**:

- User: "What services do you offer?"
- _12 seconds of silence_
- Bot: "Here's our backup service list" (no explanation)

**After**:

- User: "What services do you offer?"
- _8 seconds_
- Bot: "I'm having trouble getting the latest service info. Let me try again! ‚è≥"
- _3 seconds_
- Bot: "Great! I was able to get the current details on my second attempt! Here are all our services..."

#### üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

- **Function-specific retry messages**: Tailored communication per function type
- **Retry attempt tracking**: Logs and metadata for monitoring
- **Enhanced error context**: Better debugging with attempt numbers
- **User Agent versioning**: Track retry attempts in logs

#### üìä **IMPROVED RELIABILITY**

- **Higher success rates**: Second attempts often succeed when first fails
- **Better user confidence**: Users know the system is working hard for them
- **Reduced perceived downtime**: Communication prevents "is it broken?" confusion
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallbacks still work perfectly when retries fail

#### üéØ **USER PSYCHOLOGY BENEFITS**

- **Trust building**: Transparent communication builds confidence
- **Patience management**: Users wait longer when they know what's happening
- **Value perception**: Users appreciate the extra effort to get live data
- **Professional experience**: Handles technical issues like a human assistant would

**RESULT**: Users now experience a system that communicates clearly, tries hard to get them the best information, and never leaves them wondering what's happening! üåü
