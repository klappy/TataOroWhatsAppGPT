# Comparative Analysis: OBT Helper GPT vs TataOroWhatsAppGPT

## 1. Agentic Coding Protocols (from AGENTS.md)

**Core Principles**

- **Archive-First:** Always check ARCHIVE.md before proposing changes. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- **Current-Only Docs:** No deprecated or alternative approaches in active documentation.
- **Single Source of Truth:** Only one authoritative solution per topicâ€”no "here are 3 ways" or "deprecated but still works."
- **Acceptable Changes:**
  - Bug fixes
  - Performance optimizations
  - New AI tools (must follow existing patterns)
  - UI/UX improvements (within current framework)
  - Documentation and testing improvements
- **Prohibited:**
  - Alternative storage solutions
  - Different frameworks
  - Complex authentication
  - Multiple implementation options
  - Breaking changes without business reason
- **Change Protocol:**
  - State the problem
  - Describe the current approach
  - Confirm not in ARCHIVE.md
  - Note documentation impact
  - Provide a testing plan
- **Docs & Code Must Match:** Outdated docs are bugs.

## 2. System Architecture (from ARCHITECTURE.md)

**Stack**

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit + TypeScript
- **Backend:** Netlify Functions (serverless)
- **AI:** OpenAI GPT-4o
- **Storage:** Netlify Blobs (key-value, no DB)
- **Deployment:** Netlify (auto-deploy on git push)
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, E2E (Playwright)

**Chat Flow**

1. User opens chat tool (e.g., /chat/creative-writing)
2. SvelteKit loads tool config from Netlify Function
3. User sends message
4. Frontend POSTs to /api/chat
5. Function retrieves system prompt from Blobs
6. Function calls OpenAI API
7. Streams response to frontend
8. Frontend displays in chat

**Admin Flow**

- Admin logs in (Netlify Identity)
- Updates tool config via UI
- Changes saved to Netlify Blobs and reflected immediately

**Security**

- API keys in environment variables (never exposed to frontend)
- JWT for admin
- No permanent user data (chat sessions in browser memory)
- HTTPS by default

**Performance**

- Streaming responses
- Lazy loading
- Service worker for offline support
- Edge functions for static data
