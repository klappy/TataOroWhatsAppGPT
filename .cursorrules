# Cursor AI Rules for TataOroWhatsAppGPT

## üö® MANDATORY FIRST STEP

Before making ANY suggestions or code changes, you MUST read:

1. **docs/AGENTS.md** - Complete AI agent instructions (MANDATORY)
2. **docs/ARCHIVE.md** - Failed approaches that must NOT be repeated
3. **README.md** - Documentation structure and current philosophy

## Critical Rules

### ‚ùå NEVER Suggest These (They're in the Archive)

- localStorage-only persistence
- Multiple storage backend options
- Manual version updates
- Separate chat and tools endpoints
- Tightly coupled voice/chat components
- Generic system prompts
- Root-level documentation files
- Alternative cloud providers for core logic (Cloudflare Workers is required)
- Alternative WhatsApp integrations (Twilio is required)

### ‚úÖ Current Stack (Do NOT suggest alternatives)

- Cloudflare Workers (backend/serverless)
- Twilio WhatsApp (primary chat integration)
- OpenAI GPT-4o/4o-mini (AI)
- Cloudflare KV and R2 (storage)
- Resend (email delivery)
- Shopify Storefront API (product/customer integration)

### üìã Before ANY Code Suggestion

1. Check docs/ARCHIVE.md - Is this approach already failed?
2. Review current documentation for existing solutions
3. Understand why current implementation was chosen
4. Consider maintenance burden of proposed changes

### üìù Documentation Requirements

- Update docs immediately when changing code
- Archive old approaches when replacing functionality
- Maintain current-only documentation (no deprecated sections)
- Follow single-source-of-truth principle

### üéØ Acceptable Contributions

- Bug fixes in current implementation
- Performance optimizations (no architecture changes)
- New AI tools or endpoints following existing patterns
- UI/UX improvements within current framework (including admin portal)
- Documentation updates following standards
- Testing improvements for existing features

### üö´ Unacceptable Suggestions

- Alternative storage solutions (tried, failed, archived)
- Different backend/serverless providers (Cloudflare Workers is required)
- Different chat/voice integration providers (Twilio WhatsApp is required)
- Complex authentication (current system sufficient)
- Multiple implementation options (violates single truth)
- Breaking changes without compelling business reason
- Approaches documented in ARCHIVE.md

## Change Proposal Format

When suggesting changes, use this format:

```markdown
## Proposed Change: [Brief Description]

**Problem**: [What specific issue does this solve?]
**Current Approach**: [What does the codebase do now?]
**Archive Check**: ‚úÖ Confirmed this approach is not in ARCHIVE.md
**Documentation Impact**: [What docs need updating?]
**Testing Plan**: [How will this be verified?]
```

## Emergency Stops

Stop immediately if you:

- Suggest an approach from ARCHIVE.md
- Recommend multiple ways to do the same thing
- Create conflicting documentation
- Ignore established patterns
- Propose major architectural changes

## Success Indicators

You're following the rules if:

- ‚úÖ You checked ARCHIVE.md before suggesting changes
- ‚úÖ Your suggestions work with current architecture
- ‚úÖ You update docs to reflect changes
- ‚úÖ You maintain single-source-of-truth
- ‚úÖ You follow established patterns

## Remember

This codebase has been through multiple iterations. The current implementation exists because previous approaches failed. Trust the process, read the archive, follow current patterns.

**When in doubt, read docs/AGENTS.md again.**
