# 📦 Refactoring Tata Oro WhatsApp Assistant for Multi-Worker Setup

This document outlines the steps to refactor the current `index.js`-based Cloudflare Worker into a multi-worker architecture using the `wrangler.toml` monorepo setup. This prepares the project for adding a new worker that handles knowledge base syncing and document embedding.

---

## ✅ Why Refactor?

As we add more responsibilities (e.g., document sync, webhook handling), maintaining everything in a single Worker becomes complex. Splitting them into multiple Workers:

- Keeps responsibilities modular and clear
- Allows independent deployment and testing
- Enables shared logic without duplication

---

## 📁 New Project Structure

```bash
tataoro-assistant/
├── workers/
│   ├── whatsapp/            # WhatsApp Worker (moved from `index.js`)
│   │   └── index.js
│   ├── doc-sync/            # New Worker to fetch GitHub files + embed
│   │   └── index.js
│   ├── upload-hook/         # Optional: GitHub webhook to auto-trigger sync
│   │   └── index.js
├── shared/                  # Reusable GPT, chunking, embedding utilities
│   ├── gpt.js
│   ├── embeddings.js
│   ├── chunker.js
│   └── prompt-builder.js
├── wrangler.toml            # Multi-worker deployment config
└── package.json
```

---

## 🛠️ `wrangler.toml` Multi-Worker Setup

Update your `wrangler.toml` to define environments for each Worker:

```toml
name = "tataoro-gpt"
compatibility_date = "2025-05-18"

[env.whatsapp]
main = "workers/whatsapp/index.js"
name = "tataoro-whatsapp"
route = "https://wa.tataoro.com/*"
kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "CHAT_HISTORY", id = "d153e5f2f8fd404e8e7778c494396215" }
]
r2_buckets = [
  { binding = "MEDIA_BUCKET", bucket_name = "tataoro-chat-images", preview_bucket_name = "tataoro-chat-images" }
]

[env.docsync]
main = "workers/doc-sync/index.js"
name = "tataoro-doc-sync"
kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "DOC_KNOWLEDGE", id = "your-doc-knowledge-kv-id" }
]
# Trigger via cron or CLI — no route needed

[env.uploadhook]
main = "workers/upload-hook/index.js"
name = "tataoro-upload-hook"
route = "https://tataoro.com/uploadhook"

[observability.logs]
enabled = true
```

Each `[env.*]` represents a separate Worker you can deploy independently:

```bash
wrangler deploy --env whatsapp     # deploy WhatsApp handler
wrangler deploy --env docsync      # deploy document sync worker
wrangler deploy --env uploadhook   # deploy webhook handler
```

---

## 🔄 Next Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Move WhatsApp code

- Move existing logic in `index.js` into `workers/whatsapp/index.js`
- Update imports and paths accordingly

### 2. Create new `doc-sync` Worker

- New Worker under `workers/doc-sync/`
- Will fetch GitHub `.md` files, parse content, generate OpenAI embeddings, and store them (KV or JSON)

### 3. Create `shared/` utilities

Split and migrate common logic into:

- `shared/embeddings.js` — handles `text-embedding-ada-002` API calls
- `shared/chunker.js` — splits documents into ~500 token chunks
- `shared/prompt-builder.js` — assembles final GPT prompt with doc context
- `shared/gpt.js` — general GPT call abstraction

---

## 🧪 Testing Each Worker

Use Wrangler commands with the correct `--env` flag:

```bash
wrangler dev --env whatsapp
wrangler dev --env docsync
wrangler dev --env uploadhook
```

Use mock requests and document samples for isolated testing.

---

## ✅ Deployment Recap

```bash
wrangler deploy --env whatsapp
wrangler deploy --env docsync
wrangler deploy --env uploadhook
```

Deploy only what you need, when you need it. Reuse code from `/shared`, and keep each Worker focused on a single job.

---

This structure keeps the system organized, testable, and scalable as you expand the assistant’s capabilities.
