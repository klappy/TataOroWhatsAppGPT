# v1.1.6 – Extract System Prompt to Shared Folder

## ✨ Summary

This migration extracts the inline system prompt used in the WhatsApp assistant logic and moves it into a shared module for reusability and clarity.

## ✅ Tasks

- Create a new file: `shared/systemPrompt.js`
- Move the hardcoded system prompt string from the WhatsApp Worker into that file.
- Export it as `export const SYSTEM_PROMPT = "..."` from the module.
- Import and use `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in the WhatsApp Worker (`workers/whatsapp/index.js`)
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` if it mentions system prompt behavior inline
- Add `## v1.1.6` to `CHANGELOG.md` with a short note:
  > Extracted system prompt to shared module for maintainability

## ✅ Expected Outcome

- Prompt logic becomes reusable and easy to update.
- Reduced clutter in `index.js`.
- Simplifies future testability and potential prompt variation logic.
