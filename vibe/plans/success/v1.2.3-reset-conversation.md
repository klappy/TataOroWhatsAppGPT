# 🔄 Feature Specification: Reset Conversation via Message

## 🧭 Overview
Enable users to clear their stored consultation history by sending specific messages like "reset" or "clear". This action wipes their session data from Cloudflare KV and allows a fresh start.

## 🎯 Goals
- Respect user intent to start over or clear context
- Support re-dos, retesting, and multi-session consults
- Prevent confusion from stale or misinterpreted history

---

## 🧩 Functional Requirements

### 1. Trigger Detection
- Detect incoming message from user that matches a reset intent
- Normalize input (trim, lowercase)
- Match against keywords:
  ```js
  const resetTriggers = ["reset", "clear", "start over", "new consultation"];
  ```

### 2. KV Logic
- Construct KV key using:
  ```
  chat_history:<phoneNumber>
  ```
- Delete entry from `CHAT_HISTORY` namespace:
  ```js
  await CHAT_HISTORY.delete(`chat_history:${phoneNumber}`);
  ```

### 3. Confirmation Message
Respond with a warm, empathetic reply:
```
No problem! I’ve cleared our conversation so we can start fresh. 🌱 What would you like to do next?
```

---

## 🧰 Technical Implementation

**In `workers/whatsapp/index.js`:**
- Insert logic before calling GPT/OpenAI:
```js
const incoming = message.Body.trim().toLowerCase();
if (resetTriggers.includes(incoming)) {
  await CHAT_HISTORY.delete(`chat_history:${phoneNumber}`);
  return new TwiMLResponse("No problem! I’ve cleared our conversation so we can start fresh. 🌱 What would you like to do next?");
}
```

- Avoid unnecessary OpenAI API call if reset is detected

---

## 🔐 Security & Integrity
- Action is scoped to sender’s session only
- Low-cost operation with no side effects
- Safe even if triggered repeatedly

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### ✅ Test Cases
| Input Message       | Expected Behavior                         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `"reset"`           | KV entry deleted, reset message returned  |
| `"clear"`           | Same as above                             |
| `"start over"`      | Same as above                             |
| `"new consultation"`| Same as above                             |
| `"hi"`              | No effect, normal assistant flow continues|

## 🛠 Future Enhancements
- Support emojis or language variants (e.g., “🔁 restart”)
- Add optional confirmation (“Are you sure you want to clear?”)
- Log resets for analytics/debugging
