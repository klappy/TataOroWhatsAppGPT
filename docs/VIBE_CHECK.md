# âœ… VIBE_CHECK.md

This checklist verifies that the generated Cloudflare Worker correctly implements the WhatsApp + GPT-4o-mini consultation bot for Tata Oro. Paste this into Codex CLI to ensure proper structure, API calls, and behavior.

---

## âœ… Core File Structure

- [x] `workers/whatsapp-incoming.js` exists and uses the Cloudflare `fetch` handler pattern
- [x] `workers/summary.js` exists for `/summary/:conversationId`
- [x] `workers/images.js` exists for `/images/*`
- [x] `workers/doc-sync.js` exists
- [x] `workers/upload-hook.js` exists
- [x] Implements shareable summary endpoint GET `/summary/:conversationId` in `workers/whatsapp.js`
- [x] Uses key names like `whatsapp:+14155551234/history.json` and `whatsapp:+14155551234/1700000000000-0.jpeg`

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    // ...
  },
};
```

## âœ… Twilio Webhook Integration

- [x] Parses incoming `POST` requests from Twilio
- [x] Extracts `Body`, `From`, and any `MediaUrl{N}` fields
- [x] Responds in valid TwiML XML:

  - Includes XML declaration: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`
  - Structure:

    ```xml
    <Response>
      <Message>Your reply</Message>
    </Response>
    ```

  - Escapes XML special characters (`&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`)

    ```json
    {
      "type": "image_url",
      "image_url": { "url": "https://..." }
    }
    ```

  - [x] If caption is present, it's included as `{ "type": "text", "text": "..." }`
