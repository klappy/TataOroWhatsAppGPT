# FEATURE_7_AUDIO_CLIP_SUPPORT

## Overview

The Audio Clip Support feature enables the Tata Oro WhatsApp Assistant to accept audio clips as user inputs through WhatsApp conversations. This functionality enhances the consultation process by allowing clients to send voice notes or audio messages, which are then transcribed using OpenAI Whisper and integrated into the conversation flow with OpenAI's GPT-4o model for analysis and response.

## Status

- **Implemented**: This feature is fully implemented and operational as of version 1.1.0.
- **Updated**: As of June 2025, the implementation now uses OpenAI Whisper for transcription, and sends the transcribed text to GPT-4o, rather than sending base64-encoded audio.

## Motivation

Incorporating audio input support addresses several key needs in the consultation process:

- **Accessibility**: Allows clients who prefer verbal communication to express their concerns or describe their hair care needs more naturally.
- **Rich Data**: Audio messages can convey tone, emotion, and context that text may not fully capture, providing richer data for the assistant to analyze.
- **User Convenience**: Simplifies the user experience by enabling quick voice recordings instead of typing lengthy messages, especially on mobile devices.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **Media Processing in WhatsApp Incoming Worker**

- **File**: `workers/whatsapp-incoming.js`
- **Functionality**:

  - Detects incoming media files from WhatsApp messages via Twilio's webhook data (`NumMedia` and `MediaUrl` parameters).
  - Downloads audio files using Twilio's API with Basic Authentication (`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`).
  - Stores the audio file in Cloudflare R2 (`MEDIA_BUCKET`) for archival purposes with a unique key based on the user's phone number and timestamp.
  - Sends the audio data to OpenAI Whisper API for transcription.
  - The transcribed text is then included in the user message payload sent to GPT-4o, as a text message (not as base64 audio).
  - The session history records the transcription as a user message, and the original audio reference is also stored for traceability.

- **Key Code Snippet**:
  ```javascript
  if (mainType === "audio") {
    // Send audio to OpenAI Whisper API for transcription
    const supportedFormat = extension === "ogg" ? "mp3" : extension;
    const transcription = await transcribeAudio(buffer, supportedFormat, env.OPENAI_API_KEY);
    r2Urls.push({
      type: "audio_transcription",
      transcription: transcription,
      original_key: key,
    });
  }
  ```

### 2. **Integration with OpenAI API**

- **File**: `shared/gpt.js`
- **Functionality**:

  - The transcribed text from Whisper is included in the user message content array as a text message.
  - The GPT-4o model receives the transcription as part of the conversation, enabling it to analyze and respond to the user's spoken input.

- **Key Code Snippet**:
  ```javascript
  if (r2Urls.length > 0) {
    const contentArray = [];
    r2Urls.forEach((item) => {
      if (item.type === "audio_transcription") {
        contentArray.push({ type: "text", text: `Transcribed Audio: ${item.transcription}` });
      } else if (item.type === "image_url") {
        contentArray.push({ type: "image_url", image_url: item.image_url });
      }
    });
    if (body) contentArray.push({ type: "text", text: body });
    messages.push({ role: "user", content: contentArray });
  }
  ```

### 3. **Session Management**

- **File**: `workers/whatsapp-incoming.js`
- **Functionality**:
  - Stores audio URLs and transcriptions in the session data within Cloudflare KV (`CHAT_HISTORY`) to maintain conversation history, ensuring subsequent interactions can reference prior audio inputs.
  - Updates progress status to reflect receipt of audio (`photo-received` state) to manage consultation flow.

### 4. **System Prompt Update**

- **File**: `shared/systemPrompt.js`
- **Functionality**:
  - The system prompt has been updated to instruct the assistant to consider audio messages or voice notes as part of the consultation data, ensuring the AI model integrates audio input into its analysis and responses.

### 5. **Testing**

- **File**: `__tests__/whatsapp-audio.test.js`
- **Functionality**:
  - Comprehensive test suite to simulate incoming WhatsApp messages with audio content.
  - Validates correct processing, storage, transcription, and formatting of audio data for OpenAI API compatibility.
  - Ensures the assistant's response mechanism handles audio inputs appropriately and that the transcription is present in the session history.

## User Experience

- **Sending Audio**: Clients can send voice notes or audio clips via WhatsApp, which are automatically processed by the assistant.
- **Assistant Response**: The assistant transcribes and interprets the audio content, responding with relevant advice or follow-up questions as part of the curly hair consultation.
- **Consultation Summary**: Audio inputs are noted in the consultation summary, ensuring Tata Oro receives a complete picture of the client's input, including verbal descriptions.

## Limitations and Future Enhancements

- **Format Support**: Currently, audio formats are mapped to `mp3` for compatibility. Future enhancements could include broader format support or conversion mechanisms if OpenAI API expands its capabilities.
- **Transcription Accuracy**: Dependent on OpenAI's transcription quality. Future iterations could integrate alternative transcription services for comparison or fallback.
- **Audio Length**: Very long audio clips may face processing limitations. Implementing chunking or summarization for lengthy audio inputs could be explored.

## Documentation and Issue Tracking

- **Issue Reference**: Originally tracked under `docs/issues/01-new/audio-clip-support.md`, now closed and moved to `docs/issues/05-closed/audio-clip-support.md`.
- **Changelog Entry**: Detailed in `CHANGELOG.md` under version 1.1.0, consolidating multiple updates related to audio support implementation and fixes.

This feature significantly enhances the Tata Oro WhatsApp Assistant's ability to engage with clients through diverse input methods, improving the overall consultation experience.
