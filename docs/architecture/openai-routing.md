# ðŸ§  OpenAI Routing & Prompt Behavior

## ðŸ§­ Overview
How the assistant guides the conversation using GPT, structured prompts, and message-state logic.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Prompt Strategy

- Lives in `shared/systemPrompt.js`
- Defines tone, service knowledge, and goals
- Includes instructions for:
  - Emoji use
  - Asking one question at a time
  - Hair-specific terminology
  - Summary generation logic

---

## ðŸ“¥ GPT Request Construction

```js
const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: SYSTEM_PROMPT },
  ...history,
  { role: "user", content: userMessage }
];
```

- Vision inputs (images) may be added with `image_url` blocks
- Assistant is guided to synthesize, not guess

---

## ðŸ§¾ Summary Flow

- Assistant is instructed to produce a structured Markdown summary
- When a summary is generated (manually or via timeout email), it is stored in the session along with a shareable URL.
- On each GPT request the worker injects this summary and link back into the messages array as `assistant` role entries.
- This allows GPT to reference the summary naturally without any regex-based overrides.

## âœ… Notes

- GPT failures are caught and logged
- Prompt is versioned for future refinement
