# v1.1.6 – Deployment Entry-Point Bugfix

## 🐞 Issue

The deployment process is failing with the error:

```
✘ [ERROR] Missing entry-point to Worker script or to assets directory
```

## 🛠️ Fix Instructions

1. **Check and update the `wrangler.toml` file** to ensure that the correct entry point for the worker script is defined.

2. For the WhatsApp Worker, verify that the file path is correct. It should be:

```toml
[env.whatsapp]
main = "workers/whatsapp/index.js"
```

3. Ensure the directory structure matches:

```
workers/
└── whatsapp/
    └── index.js
```

4. If the `main` value is incorrect or missing, add it manually to the `[env.whatsapp]` block.

5. After the fix, update:

   - `README.md`: Describe the entry-point requirement.
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Note the directory structure and the `wrangler.toml` role.
   - `CHANGELOG.md`: Add a new version header `## v1.1.6` with a brief summary:  
     `Fix missing entry-point error in Wrangler deploy by setting main path explicitly.`

6. Commit all updated files with the message:

```
v1.1.6
```

7. After verifying the fix, place this file in `docs/issues/05-closed/`.

---

This patch ensures successful deployment by clarifying and enforcing the required `main` field in Wrangler's config.
