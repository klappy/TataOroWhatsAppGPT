## Description

This issue addresses the need to accept audio clips as inputs from users in the Tata Oro WhatsApp Assistant. The goal is to enable users to send voice messages or audio notes that can be processed and integrated into the consultation process.

## Proposed Solution

- Update the 'whatsapp-incoming.js' worker to detect and process audio media types.
- Store audio files in Cloudflare R2, similar to how images are handled.
- Format audio URLs for potential integration with the OpenAI API for transcription or analysis.
- Update the system prompt to acknowledge audio content in conversations.

## Implementation Details

- Modified 'whatsapp-incoming.js' to handle audio files, storing them in R2 and formatting them as 'audio_url' for OpenAI API compatibility.
- Updated 'systemPrompt.js' to include audio messages or voice notes as part of the data to collect during consultations.
- Added changelog entry in 'CHANGELOG.md' under version 'v1.0.2' to document the new feature.

## Resolution

The feature to accept audio clips as inputs has been successfully implemented. Users can now send audio messages via WhatsApp, which are processed and stored in Cloudflare R2. The system prompt has been updated to reflect this capability, ensuring the AI can respond appropriately to audio content.
