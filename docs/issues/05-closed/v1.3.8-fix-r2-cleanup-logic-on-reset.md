# 🐛 Issue: Fix R2 Cleanup Logic on Conversation Reset

## ❗️ Summary

Reset logic was not removing all uploaded images for a user because it did not account for the per-user key prefix in R2.

When a conversation is reset, orphaned images remained in R2 under the user's prefix, leading to unexpected storage growth.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The cleanup code only listed plain filenames, but R2 stores objects with the full key format:

```text
whatsapp:+{E164PhoneNumber}/{timestamp}-{index}.jpeg
```

Without the prefix, `delete()` calls did not match any objects.

---

## ✅ Resolution

Update the reset handler to list and delete objects using the full user prefix:

```js
const prefix = `whatsapp:${phoneNumber}/`;
const list = await MEDIA_BUCKET.list({ prefix });
for await (const { key } of list) {
  await MEDIA_BUCKET.delete(key);
}
```

---

## 🧠 Future Prevention

- Always include the R2 object key prefix when performing batch deletes.
- Add unit tests to simulate multiple image uploads and ensure cleanup removes all prefixed keys.
