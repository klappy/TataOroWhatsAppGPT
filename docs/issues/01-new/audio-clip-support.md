# Audio Clip Support for WhatsApp Assistant

## Description

This issue addresses the integration of audio clip support in the Tata Oro WhatsApp Assistant. Currently, the system handles text and image inputs via Twilio WhatsApp webhooks, processing them through Cloudflare Workers and integrating with OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini. The goal is to extend this functionality to accept audio clips as inputs, allowing users to send voice messages that can be processed and responded to by the AI.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The system should detect and process audio files received via Twilio WhatsApp webhooks.
- Audio files should be downloaded, stored in Cloudflare R2, and associated with the user's session history, similar to image handling.
- If supported by the OpenAI API, audio URLs should be formatted and included in the message payload for AI processing. If not, an alternative approach such as audio transcription to text should be implemented.
- The system prompt should be updated to acknowledge audio content in conversations, ensuring appropriate AI responses.
- Documentation should be updated to reflect the new audio support feature, including changes in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and an entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Test cases should be developed to validate audio file processing, storage, and integration with the chat system.

## Implementation Notes

- Modify `whatsapp-incoming.js` to handle audio media types, determining file extensions from content type headers.
- Investigate OpenAI API capabilities for direct audio processing or identify a transcription service for converting audio to text.
- Ensure robust error handling for audio processing failures to maintain user experience.

## Status

- **Resolved**: false
