# Async Flow Documentation Restructure

## Description

The `docs/architecture/async-flow.md` document has been restructured from describing the message lifecycle and flow through Cloudflare Workers to describing the issue resolution workflow. This represents a fundamental change in the document's purpose.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document now describes project structure for issue management
- [ ] Document explains issue resolution workflow using `docs/issues/open/` structure
- [ ] Document provides clear instructions for Codex CLI on how to handle issues
- [ ] Document includes steps for moving issues from open to closed
- [ ] Document maintains clear formatting and structure

## Notes

This appears to be a major structural change where the async flow documentation has been replaced with issue workflow documentation. Need to verify if this is intentional or if the async flow content should be preserved elsewhere.
