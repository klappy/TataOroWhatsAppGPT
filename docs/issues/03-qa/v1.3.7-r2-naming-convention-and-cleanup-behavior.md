[DOCS] Update R2 Naming Convention and Cleanup Behavior in Architecture Docs

Summary:
The Cloudflare R2 storage structure uses a per-user prefix pattern (whatsapp:+{phoneNumber}/) when saving images. This structure is currently undocumented in ARCHITECTURE.md and related design files, which likely contributes to the failure in deleting image objects during conversation resets.

Problem:
â€¢ Documentation implies a flat R2 structure but the actual format uses nested paths like:
whatsapp:+14232807430/1747559515643-0.jpeg
â€¢ Reset and cleanup logic may fail if it attempts to delete just 1747559515643-0.jpeg instead of including the full key with prefix.
â€¢ New developers or reviewers are unaware of the storage schema, leading to fragile or incorrect assumptions.

Action Items:
â€¢ Update ðŸ“¦ R2 Image Handling section in ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect actual R2 object key format:

whatsapp:+{E164PhoneNumber}/{timestamp}-{index}.jpeg

    â€¢	Clarify that deletion must include this full key when calling MEDIA_BUCKET.delete(key).
    â€¢	Add visual examples to help developers identify correct prefixing logic (based on Cloudflare dashboard screenshot).
    â€¢	Update any relevant documentation with a section on deletion strategy, including:
    â€¢	Ensure antifragile strategies are used
