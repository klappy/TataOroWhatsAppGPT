[ENHANCEMENT] Stateless Summary Endpoint for Long Conversations

⸻

🧠 Summary

For long consultations that exceed WhatsApp’s message length limits, we need a minimal, antifragile way to share the full consultation summary. Instead of storing or generating new pages, this enhancement introduces a stateless endpoint that dynamically renders the current chat history and uploaded images using the existing KV and R2 structures.

⸻

🎯 Goals
• Serve a readable consultation summary via a short URL:
/summary/:conversationId
(where conversationId = whatsapp:+{phoneNumber} or a tokenized equivalent)
• Dynamically render:
• Messages (user, assistant)
• Consultation metadata (progress_status, last_active, summary)
• Uploaded images from R2 (whatsapp:+{phoneNumber}/)
• Display each image in the conversation based on the timestamp in the filename
• Avoid any writes, pre-generation, or separate summary storage.

⸻

✅ Acceptance Criteria

1. A GET request to /summary/:conversationId returns a readable HTML page.
2. Page includes all chat messages, metadata, and inline <img> tags for any R2-hosted assets.
3. No phone number or PII appears in the URL (if obfuscation is applied).
4. Summary is always up-to-date—reflecting live KV and R2 state.
5. Endpoint is linkable in WhatsApp messages when summary size exceeds length limits.
6. The UI/UX needs to be an exact clone of WhatsApp for design language.

🛠 Implementation Plan
• Extend workers/whatsapp/index.js or create workers/summary.js to handle /summary/:id.
• In handler:
• Fetch KV using key chat_history:whatsapp:+{phoneNumber}.
• List R2 objects using prefix whatsapp:+{phoneNumber}/.
• Render an HTML page using messages, summary, and image list.
• Optionally use Base64(phoneNumber) or similar to avoid exposing raw numbers in the URL.
• Add minimal styling + fallback text if no chat found or no images uploaded.
• Test with real image uploads and various summary lengths.

⸻

🔐 Privacy & Security
• No raw phone numbers in the URL if obfuscation is enabled.
• Summary is private by obscurity (not indexed).
