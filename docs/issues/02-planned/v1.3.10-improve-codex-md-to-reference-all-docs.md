 # v1.3.10 – Improve root `codex.md` and enable automatic prompt invocation

 ## Summary

 Update the root-level `codex.md` instructions to explicitly reference all developer documentation
 under the `docs/` directory (architecture, decisions, conventions, schema, issues, VIBE_CHECK).
 Additionally, configure a built-in alias (`codex sync-issues`) so that users can automatically run the prompt:

 ```
 read ./docs/issues/codex.md and find any issues in the sub-folders and take them step by step through the issue flow.
 ```

 without manually typing it each time.

 ## Tasks

 1. Extend `codex.md` (root) with a new section listing all top-level `docs/` subdirectories
    and key markdown files (architecture, decisions, conventions, schema, issues, VIBE_CHECK).
 2. Instruct users or configure Codex CLI to support an alias (`codex sync-issues`)
    that runs the above prompt automatically.
 3. Add example usage in the documentation.

 ## Acceptance Criteria

 - `codex.md` (root) includes a “Developer Docs” section with links to:
   - `/docs/architecture/`
   - `/docs/decisions/`
   - `/docs/conventions/`
   - `/docs/chatHistory.schema.md`
   - `/docs/issues/`
   - `/docs/VIBE_CHECK.md`
 - Codex CLI alias `sync-issues` is documented in `codex.md`.
 - Running `codex sync-issues` executes the target prompt without additional typing.
 - An example command is shown in `codex.md`.
