# Documentation Standards for TataOroWhatsAppGPT

**Purpose**: Establish clear, consistent standards for writing, updating, and maintaining documentation in this project.  
**Audience**: All contributors (human and AI)  
**Last Updated**: Version 1.0.0  
**Status**: CURRENT - REQUIRED READING

## Core Principles

### 1. Current-Only Documentation

- **Active docs contain ONLY current, working approaches**
- **No deprecated sections** - everything outdated gets archived
- **No version comparisons** - only document what works now
- **Single source of truth** per topic

### 2. Documentation as Code

- **Docs and code must stay in sync** - outdated docs are bugs
- **Update docs with every code change** - no exceptions
- **Review docs in every PR** - documentation changes are code changes
- **Test all examples** - if it's documented, it must work

### 3. Archive Everything Old

- **Failed approaches go to ARCHIVE.md** - prevent repeated mistakes
- **Replaced implementations get archived** - maintain clean current state
- **Document why things failed** - context prevents repetition
- **Cross-reference archived content** - maintain discoverability

## Documentation Structure

### Required Top-Level Docs

- **README.md** - Project overview, setup, quickstart
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System design, data flows, diagrams
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history and notable changes

### Required docs/ Directory

- **AGENTS.md** - AI agent instructions and contributor protocols
- **ARCHIVE.md** - Failed approaches and deprecated solutions
- **API.md** - Complete API reference with examples
- **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Local development and deployment
- **DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md** - This document
- **TESTING.md** - Testing strategy and instructions
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Common issues and solutions

### Optional Subdirectories

- **docs/architecture/** - Detailed architectural documents
- **docs/decisions/** - Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- **docs/features/** - Feature-specific documentation
- **docs/conventions/** - Coding and naming conventions

## Writing Standards

### Document Structure

```markdown
# Document Title

**Purpose**: Brief description of what this document covers
**Audience**: Who should read this
**Last Updated**: Version or date
**Status**: CURRENT | ARCHIVED | DRAFT

## Overview

Brief introduction and scope

## Main Content

Organized in logical sections with clear headings

## Examples

Working code examples that can be copy-pasted

## Related Documents

Links to other relevant documentation
```

### Language and Tone

- **Clear and concise** - no unnecessary jargon
- **Action-oriented** - tell readers what to do
- **Specific and concrete** - avoid vague statements
- **Consistent terminology** - use the same terms throughout

### Code Examples

- **All examples must work** - test before documenting
- **Include full context** - don't assume prior knowledge
- **Show expected output** - demonstrate what success looks like
- **Use real values** - avoid placeholder text when possible

### Links and References

- **Use relative links** for internal documentation
- **Keep links current** - broken links are bugs
- **Link to source code** when referencing implementation
- **Cross-reference related concepts**

## Update Process

### When Code Changes

1. **Identify affected docs** - what documentation needs updating?
2. **Update current docs** - reflect new reality immediately
3. **Archive old approaches** - if replacing existing functionality
4. **Test all examples** - ensure they still work
5. **Update cross-references** - maintain link integrity

### When Adding New Features

1. **Document the feature** - in appropriate location
2. **Update API docs** - if adding endpoints
3. **Update ARCHITECTURE.md** - if changing system design
4. **Add to CHANGELOG.md** - record the change
5. **Update README.md** - if affecting setup or usage

### When Deprecating Features

1. **Move to ARCHIVE.md** - don't just delete
2. **Document why it failed** - prevent repetition
3. **Update all references** - remove or redirect links
4. **Clean up examples** - remove non-working code
5. **Update related docs** - maintain consistency

## Archive Management

### What Gets Archived

- **Failed implementation approaches** - with reasons why they failed
- **Deprecated features** - with migration guidance
- **Outdated architectural decisions** - with context for changes
- **Replaced tools or libraries** - with rationale for replacement

### Archive Format

```markdown
## [Archived] Feature/Approach Name

**Date Archived**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Reason**: Brief explanation of why this was abandoned
**Context**: What was tried, what failed, lessons learned
**Replacement**: Link to current approach (if applicable)

### Details

Full explanation of what was attempted and why it didn't work.
```

### Archive Organization

- **Chronological order** - newest archives first
- **Clear categorization** - group related failures
- **Searchable content** - use consistent keywords
- **Cross-referenced** - link to related successes/failures

## Review Process

### Documentation Reviews

- **Every PR includes doc review** - treat docs as code
- **Check for accuracy** - does it match the implementation?
- **Verify examples** - do they work as written?
- **Validate links** - are all references current?
- **Assess completeness** - is anything missing?

### Periodic Audits

- **Monthly doc audits** - check for outdated content
- **Quarterly archive reviews** - ensure failures are well-documented
- **Annual structure reviews** - optimize organization

## Quality Metrics

### Documentation Health

- **All code examples work** - 100% success rate
- **No broken links** - internal or external
- **Current content only** - no deprecated information
- **Complete coverage** - all features documented

### Success Indicators

- **New contributors can get started** - clear onboarding
- **Common questions are answered** - good troubleshooting
- **Failures are prevented** - effective archive
- **Changes are easy to make** - good structure

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Documentation Debt

- Don't defer doc updates - update immediately
- Don't leave TODO comments - finish the documentation
- Don't assume someone else will document - own it

### ❌ Deprecated Content

- Don't leave old approaches in active docs
- Don't create "legacy" sections - archive instead
- Don't document multiple ways to do the same thing

### ❌ Broken Examples

- Don't document untested code
- Don't use placeholder values that don't work
- Don't assume examples will stay current

### ❌ Poor Organization

- Don't create deep nested structures
- Don't duplicate information across docs
- Don't use inconsistent naming conventions

## Tools and Automation

### Recommended Tools

- **Markdown linters** - enforce consistent formatting
- **Link checkers** - catch broken references
- **Example testers** - verify code samples work
- **Spell checkers** - maintain professional quality

### Automation Opportunities

- **Auto-generate API docs** - from code comments
- **Link validation** - in CI/CD pipeline
- **Example testing** - as part of test suite
- **Archive reminders** - when deprecating features

## Enforcement

### Required for All Contributors

- **Read this document** - before contributing
- **Follow the standards** - no exceptions
- **Update docs with code** - always
- **Archive old approaches** - maintain clean state

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect code changes
- [ ] All examples tested and working
- [ ] Links validated and current
- [ ] Old approaches archived with context
- [ ] Cross-references updated
- [ ] Writing follows style guidelines

**Remember**: Good documentation is not optional. It's a core part of the codebase that enables collaboration, prevents mistakes, and ensures long-term maintainability.
