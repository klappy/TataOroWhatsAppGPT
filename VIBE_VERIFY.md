This checklist verifies that the generated Cloudflare Worker correctly implements the WhatsApp + GPT-4o-mini consultation bot for Tata Oro. Paste this into Codex CLI to ensure proper structure, API calls, and behavior.

---

## âœ… Core File Structure

- [x] A Cloudflare Worker file exists (e.g., `src/index.js`, `worker.js`, or `index.ts`)
- [x] It uses the Cloudflare `fetch` handler pattern

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // ...
  },
};
```

---

## âœ… Twilio Webhook Integration

- [x] Parses incoming `POST` requests from Twilio
- [x] Extracts `Body`, `From`, and any `MediaUrl{N}` fields
- [x] Responds in valid TwiML XML:

```xml
<Response>
  <Message>Your reply</Message>
</Response>
```

- [x] Sets headers: `Content-Type: application/xml`

---

## âœ… GPT-4o-mini Integration

- [x] Uses OpenAIâ€™s Chat Completion API at `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- [x] Model used is `gpt-4o-mini`
- [x] Sends a `system` prompt that includes:
  > "You are a warm, empathetic, and knowledgeable virtual assistant for Tata Oro..."

- [x] If media is detected, sends `image_url` input to GPT-4o-mini (for vision use)
