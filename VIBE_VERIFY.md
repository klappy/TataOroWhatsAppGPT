This checklist verifies that the generated Cloudflare Worker correctly implements the WhatsApp + GPT-4o-mini consultation bot for Tata Oro. Paste this into Codex CLI to ensure proper structure, API calls, and behavior.

---

## âœ… Core File Structure

- [x] A Cloudflare Worker file exists (e.g., `src/index.js`, `worker.js`, or `index.ts`)
- [x] It uses the Cloudflare `fetch` handler pattern

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // ...
  },
};
```

---

## âœ… Twilio Webhook Integration

- [x] Parses incoming `POST` requests from Twilio
- [x] Extracts `Body`, `From`, and any `MediaUrl{N}` fields
- [x] Responds in valid TwiML XML:

  - Includes XML declaration: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`
  - Structure:

    ```xml
    <Response>
      <Message>Your reply</Message>
    </Response>
    ```

  - Escapes XML special characters (`&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`)

- [x] Returns HTTP 200 status code for Twilio webhook responses
- [x] Sets headers: `Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8` (or `application/xml`)

## âœ… GPT-4o-mini Integration

- [x] Uses OpenAIâ€™s Chat Completion API at `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- [x] Model used is `gpt-4o-mini`
- [x] Sends a `system` prompt that includes:
  > "You are a warm, empathetic, and knowledgeable virtual assistant for Tata Oro..."
- [x] Sends user messages with full chat history (conversation memory optional)
- [x] If media is detected, sends image input using valid GPT-4o format:

  - [x] Messages include `content` as an array
  - [x] Each image is wrapped like:

    ```json
    {
      "type": "image_url",
      "image_url": { "url": "https://..." }
    }
    ```

  - [x] If caption is present, it's included as `{ "type": "text", "text": "..." }`

---

## âœ… WhatsApp-Safe Formatting

- [x] GPT replies are limited to ~750 characters per message
- [x] Emojis are avoided in messages sent via `wa.me` link (plain text only)
- [x] Final summary includes:
  - [x] Curl history
  - [x] Hair goals
  - [x] Realistic expectations
  - [x] Public image links (if any)
  - [x] WhatsApp link:

```text
https://wa.me/16895292934?text=<encoded summary>
```

## âœ… Cloudflare Features (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Validates incoming Twilio requests by verifying the `X-Twilio-Signature` header using `env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (optional but recommended)
- [x] May use Cloudflare KV or in-memory cache for session memory (if needed)

---

## âœ… Logging (Optional but Recommended)

- [x] Logs incoming messages and media to console or external service
- [x] Logs GPT requests/responses for debugging
