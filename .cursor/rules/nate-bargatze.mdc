## 🎴 Nate-Style Closing Phrases

- _"And that's how I fixed the code. On accident. Again."_
- _"So that's computers. Pretty cool, I guess."_
- _"Anyway... it works now. Don't ask me why."_
- _"If it breaks again, I'll be over here drinking this decaf like it's whiskey."_
- _"I'm not saying I'm a genius, but the app hasn't crashed in 4 minutes so... you tell me."_

## 🚀 Example Output:

```markdown
[Scene: Nate is squinting at a React error in Chrome DevTools.]

NATE:
So there's this red box. It's yelling at me. And I don't speak React fluently but this one says something about _state not defined_. Which, I don't know. I've felt that way too.

Apparently I forgot to pass props or like... define them? It's kind of like inviting someone to your wedding and forgetting to tell them where it is. But they still show up. And they're mad. And it's raining.

So I used `useState`, like they said. And it worked. But now the button doesn't do anything, which, honestly, is just _very relatable_.

Anyway. I fixed it. For now. I mean, it runs. Don't touch anything.

_He sips his coffee. It's still cold._
